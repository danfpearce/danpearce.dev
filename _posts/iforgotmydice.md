For years now I've been volunteering at our local library leading Dungeons and Dragons games for teens. My D&D roots go way back. I was playing the game when I was their age and I love seeing a group of kids come together and work together. Even though the game may be in our imaginations, the bonds they form and the memories they make are real and lasting. Covid forced us online for a few years but now we're back in person. As much as I try to get them away from their screens, I sometimes just don't have enough spare sets of dice for everyone. So, I made a little React app that they can use.

I was certainly not trying to create the best dice roller out there. Lord knows there are dice rollers aplenty. I wanted to learn some React and what better way to learn than to create something useful?

Enjoy the adventure!
