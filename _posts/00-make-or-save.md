When I first started in my career I remember learning that you get hired to solve a company's problems. This is true, of course. I've certainly solved my share of problems over my career but I've learned that it's not simply the problems you solve that make you an attractive hire or employee, it (sadly) also comes down to the economics. Are you making money for the company or are you saving money for the company?

I've had the opportunity to mentor dozens of people in my career- some who are just starting in their development careers. One of the big decisions they have to make is: should I work at an agency or a more traditional product or service-based company? This question is likely fodder for a new post, but I make sure to have them think about the "make or save" question.

As an agency developer, you are most likely working for clients on behalf of your agency. You are making money for the company in your role. That is really good information to know. The more work you do for the agency on behalf of its clients, the more money you make for the agency. Pretty simple, really (if we don't get into the details of project billing).

If you don't work for an agency, you are likely in the "save money" category. It behooves you to find ways to increase efficienty, or at least be able to argue that you are doing so. Proposing a refactor or a replatform? Great! Just be ready to provide ways that your work will save money for the company in the long run- otherwise known as the ROI (return on investment). 

Once you think about your job or prospective job in this way, you can make smart decisions in your career that will keep you in the financial good graces of the company.
